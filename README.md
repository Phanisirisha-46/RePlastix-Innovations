## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Automation Logic  

- When a product‚Äôs **stock < threshold**, a **task** is automatically created for the product owner.  
- The **order record** updates to show ‚ÄúLow Stock‚Äù.  
- A **replenishment request** is generated and routed for approval.  
- On approval, an **email notification** is sent to the **warehouse manager**.  

This ensures continuous inventory tracking and efficient communication between teams.

## üìä Reporting & Analytics  
Leveraged **Salesforce Reports & Dashboards** to monitor:  
- Inventory levels  
- Order fulfillment rates  
- Replenishment request timelines
